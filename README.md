## Introduction

Spectroscopy data can be complex and require specialized machine learning techniques to make accurate predictions. This code demonstrates the process of loading, preprocessing, and training a machine learning model on spectroscopy data to classify samples as positive or negative.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- joblib

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn joblib
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepository.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd YourRepository
```

3. Run the Python script to train the machine learning model:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

## Usage

The provided Python script `train_model.py` demonstrates the entire process of loading the data, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. It includes functions for data augmentation, preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.

You can customize various parameters and settings in the script to experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques. 

## Results

After running the script, the model will be trained on the provided spectroscopy data. The script will output the training history, including loss and accuracy plots, as well as evaluation metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. These metrics will give you an idea of how well the model performs on the test data.
